// from JSLint instructions:

Some of ES6â€™s features are good, so JSLint will recognize the good parts of ES6.

Currently, these features are recognized:

    The ... ellipsis marker in parameter lists and argument lists, replacing the arguments object for
     variadic functions.

    The let statement, which is like the var statement except that it respects block scope. You may 
    use let or var but not both.

    The const statement is like the let statement except that it disallows the use of assignment on 
    the variable, although if the value of the variable is mutable, but can still be mutated. const 
    is preferred to let.

    Destructuring of arrays and objects is allowed in parameter lists and on the left side of let, 
    and const, but not var or assignment statements, and not deep destructuring or eliding.

    Enhanced object literals, providing shorter forms for function declaration and properties that 
    are initialized by variables with the same name.

    The fat arrow => fart functions.

    The simplest forms of import and export.

    `Megastring` literals, but not nested `megastring` literals.

    New global functions, such as Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet.

    0b- and 0o- number literals.
